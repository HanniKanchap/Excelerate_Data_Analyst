## Internship Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for my internship project, **Excelerate Data Analyst Dashboard**. This project showcases my hands-on experience with data cleaning, visualization, and database management, integrating the use of **Google Looker Studio** and **PostgreSQL**.

## Project Description

During my internship, I was tasked with transforming raw datasets into actionable insights. My main responsibilities involved:

- **Data Cleaning:** Efficiently cleaned and pre-processed large datasets to ensure data quality, consistency, and reliability for analysis.
- **Database Management with PostgreSQL:** Utilized PostgreSQL to store, query, and manipulate cleaned data, demonstrating proficiency with SQL for data extraction and transformation.
- **Visualization with Looker Studio:** Designed and built interactive data dashboards using Google Looker Studio to present key findings and trends to stakeholders.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python & Pandas:** For data cleaning, wrangling, and transformation.
- **PostgreSQL:** As the primary relational database for storing and querying data.
- **Google Looker Studio:** For building insightful and interactive dashboards.
- **SQL:** For data manipulation and analysis within PostgreSQL.
  
## Highlights

- Improved data quality and reduced inconsistencies by applying robust cleaning techniques.
- Automated ETL pipelines for seamless data flow between sources and PostgreSQL.
- Developed dynamic dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.
